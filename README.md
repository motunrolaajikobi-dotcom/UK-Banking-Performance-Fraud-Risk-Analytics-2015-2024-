 ### Desciption
This project analyses the financial performance, efficiency, and fraud risk of 20 UK financial institutions over a 10-year period (2015–2024), showing the top 10 in financial performance and fraud risk.
 The project demonstrates how financial and fraud data can be combined to support risk-based decision making.
 ### Objective
The goal was to simulate a real-world fraud and financial analytics environment, using a messy, multi-year dataset to build interactive Excel dashboards that provide insights into:
-	Bank profitability
-	Cost efficiency
-	Interest income reliance
-	Fraud losses
-	Risk ratings
- Early warning signals
### Process
Steps taken to prepare the dataset:
#### Step 1 
The dataset was cleaned and enhanced using:
-	Excel formulas
-	Power Query
-	Calculated fields
-	Data standardization (Risk Rating, Bank Type)
#### Step 2
Calculated key metrics:
-	Profit Margin
-	Fraud Loss Ratio
-	Interest Income Dependency
-	Cost to income ratio

## Dashboards:
### Dashboard 1 – Financial Performance & Efficiency
Title:UK Banking Performance & Efficiency Overview (2015–2024)
Focuses on:
-	Net profit by bank
-	Cost-to-income ratio
-	Interest income dependency
-	Profitability KPI's
### Which answers:
-	Which banks are most profitable?
-	Who is most efficient?
-	How stable is revenue over time?

### Dashboard 2 – Fraud, Risk & Early Warning
Title:Fraud Risk & Financial Crime Exposure Across UK Banks (2015-2024)
Focuses on:
-	Fraud loss trends
-	Fraud by risk rating
-	Suspicious transaction patterns

### Which answers:
-	Where is fraud concentrated?
-	Are risk ratings predictive?
-	Which banks need intervention?

### Key insights
-	Traditional banks are more profitable but carry much higher fraud exposure.
-	Digital banks show better fraud control but lower profitability.
-	Fraud spikes during economic stress (2020–2021).
-	Rising suspicious transactions often precede fraud losses.
-	Risk ratings align strongly with actual fraud losses.
### Recommendations
-	Traditional banks should modernize fraud controls
- Use suspicious transaction spikes as early warning
-	Re-calibrate risk ratings using fraud loss data
-	Monitor cost-to-income + fraud together
-	Digital banks should focus on scaling profit safely
### Limitations
-	Synthetic data – realistic but not real bank filings
-	Extreme outliers exist 
-	No customer-level data
-	Risk ratings are subjective
-	Macroeconomic variables not included
#### This project demonstrates my ability to combine financial performance data with fraud risk indicators to produce actionable insights through interactive Excel dashboards.
